//A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. 
//This means that a leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are exactly 
// divisible by 100, 
//but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. 
//For example, the year 2000 was a leap year because it is divisible by 400, 
// while the year 1900 was not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by
//  400.
